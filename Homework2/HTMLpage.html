		<p>According to market research company <a href="http://www.newworldwealth.com/welcome.html">New World Wealth</a>, the world has accumulated $215 trillion in private wealth, a 12% increase over the last year.</p>
		<p>Incredibly, the vast majority of this wealth – about 73.5% – is held by just 10 countries:</p>

		<p>Over the last decade, China and India have more than doubled their wealth. Meanwhile, developed economies like the United States and Japan have increased wealth at modest rates – and some, like Italy and France, even lost modest amounts of private wealth over that duration of time.</p>
		<p>Finally, it should be noted that the United Kingdom’s decrease above is mainly due to the depreciation of the GBP, which dropped in dollar terms from roughly $2.00 to $1.35 over the decade in question.</p>
